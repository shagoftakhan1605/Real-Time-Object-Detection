## Introduction

This project implements real-time object detection using the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) model, known for its high speed and accuracy. The application features a `tkinter`-based GUI that processes each frame from a webcam in real-time, displaying both the detected objects and the processed video stream. Additionally, the project explores advanced research topics such as class imbalance and multi-class detection, offering mathematical insights into these challenges.

## Features

- **Real-Time Object Detection:** Capture and process video frames from a webcam in real-time using YOLOv3.
- **GUI Integration:** An intuitive `tkinter`-based GUI for easy interaction and visualization.
- **Multi-Class Detection:** Detect multiple object classes simultaneously in each video frame.
- **Class Imbalance Handling:** Discusses and implements techniques to address the challenge of class imbalances in detection tasks.
- **Mathematical Insights:** Provides a detailed explanation of the mathematics behind solving class imbalance in object detection.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pip package manager

### Required Libraries

Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python pillow tkinter numpy
```

### Download YOLOv3 Files

You will need the following YOLOv3 files:

- [YOLOv3 Configuration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z3g7fMj3ubx1GGO5cSbl3adY_bCcmED3/view?usp=sharing)
- [YOLOv3 Weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p3f9YDKFTRDDJXmDZUGXqv9sgWq-38WB/view?usp=sharing)
- [COCO Dataset Labels](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QmJin0Y0ASB5Kn9XCkgnQkcS2wPAnvRj/view?usp=sharing)

Ensure that `yolov3.cfg`, `yolov3.weights`, and `coco.names` are placed in the same directory as the Python script.

## Usage
The webcam feed will appear in the GUI window, and detected objects will be highlighted with bounding boxes. The names of the detected objects will be displayed in the text box below the video feed.

## Understanding the Code

### Webcam Integration

The application uses OpenCV (`cv2`) to capture video frames from the webcam. The `cv2.VideoCapture(0)` command initializes the webcam, where `0` refers to the default camera. The captured frames are processed in real-time for object detection.

### Real-Time Detection

The `update_frame()` function is the core of the real-time detection process. It captures a frame, processes it using YOLOv3, and then updates the GUI with the processed frame. This function uses a `root.after(10, update_frame)` call to continuously update the video feed every 10 milliseconds, allowing for smooth real-time performance.

### GUI with Tkinter

The graphical user interface is built using `tkinter`. The GUI consists of:
- **Image Label:** Displays the processed video frames with bounding boxes.
- **Text Box:** Lists the names of detected objects.
- **Update Frame Function:** Continuously updates the video feed and object list in the GUI.

### Class Imbalance and Multi-Class Problems

#### Class Imbalance

Class imbalance is a significant issue in object detection, where certain object classes may be underrepresented in the dataset. This can lead to biased models that perform well on majority classes but poorly on minority classes. YOLOv3 addresses this challenge using techniques like confidence thresholds and non-maxima suppression (NMS) to filter out weak detections and improve accuracy, even for underrepresented classes.

#### Multi-Class Detection

YOLOv3 is inherently designed for multi-class detection, where it predicts multiple bounding boxes and class probabilities for each box. The challenge arises when the model needs to maintain high accuracy across all classes, especially when some classes are less frequent. This project showcases how YOLOv3 handles such scenarios, making it a valuable tool for exploring multi-class object detection in real-time applications.

### Mathematical Approach to Class Imbalance

In object detection, class imbalance can significantly impact the model’s performance, particularly when detecting minority classes. The following mathematical approaches and techniques are employed in YOLOv3 to mitigate these challenges:

1. **Confidence Thresholding:**

   #### $\[\text{Confidence} = P(\text{Object}) \times \text{IOU}_{\text{pred, truth}}\]$
   - **Explanation:** The confidence score is the product of the probability of the object’s existence and the Intersection Over Union (IOU) between the predicted and ground truth bounding boxes. By setting a threshold \( \tau \), typically \( \tau = 0.5 \), we filter out detections with low confidence, reducing false positives and ensuring that only the most probable detections are considered.
   - **Mathematical Impact:** Thresholding helps balance the precision-recall trade-off, especially for underrepresented classes, ensuring that only detections with sufficient confidence are retained.

3. **Non-Maxima Suppression (NMS):**

   #### $\[\text{IOU} = \frac{\text{Area of Overlap}}{\text{Area of Union}}\]$
   - **Explanation:** NMS is used to eliminate redundant bounding boxes by comparing the IOU between bounding boxes. If the IOU exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 0.4), the bounding box with the lower confidence score is suppressed.
   - **Mathematical Impact:** NMS reduces the number of false positives and ensures that the model does not produce multiple overlapping detections for the same object. This is crucial for minority classes, as it helps to prevent these classes from being overwhelmed by more frequent classes.

4. **Loss Function in YOLOv3:**

   #### $\[\text{Total Loss} = \text{Confidence Loss} + \text{Classification Loss} + \text{Bounding Box Loss}\]$
   - **Explanation:** YOLOv3 uses a multi-part loss function that combines confidence loss, classification loss, and bounding box loss. The classification loss is particularly sensitive to class imbalance, as it penalizes incorrect class predictions.
   - **Mathematical Impact:** By carefully weighting the different components of the loss function, YOLOv3 can be tuned to better handle class imbalances. Adjusting the weights can help prioritize the accurate detection of minority classes, thus improving overall model performance.

## Project Structure

- **yolov3_gui_real_time.py:** Main script for running the real-time detection application.
- **yolov3.cfg:** Configuration file for YOLOv3.
- **yolov3.weights:** Pre-trained weights for YOLOv3 on the COCO dataset.
- **coco.names:** List of class labels used in the COCO dataset.

## Research Relevance

### Addressing Class Imbalance

In real-world applications, data is rarely evenly distributed among classes. For instance, in a surveillance system, there might be more instances of cars than pedestrians, leading to a bias in the detection model. This project demonstrates how YOLOv3 manages such imbalances through its architecture and detection strategies, making it a relevant example for researchers interested in class imbalance issues in deep learning.

### Tackling Multi-Class Detection

Detecting multiple objects of different classes in a single image or video frame is a complex problem due to the varying scales, locations, and appearances of objects. YOLOv3's design, which includes multi-scale detection and anchor boxes, is particularly well-suited for this task. This project provides a practical demonstration of these concepts, aligning with current research interests in improving multi-class detection accuracy in semi-supervised learning environments.
